                    <h1>BILLIONAEIRS INTO SPACE….</h1>
                    <div class="article-date">February 20, 2022</div>
                    <p>In 20th century rocket science were developed
                        opening the gates to explore space. After world war 2 united states and soviet
                        nation start their way to space. On oct 4th in 1957 soviet nation launched the very
                        first artificial satellite Sputnik 1 int space. In 1958 united states sent their first
                        satellite Explore 1 into space. This way there were competition between countries
                        from the beginning of industrial revolution. Now not only the countries but the
                        multibillionaires are started competition among them. In this article I’m planning
                        to talk about competition between them and the impact of their space race to the
                        field of astronomy. As we all know until recently there were only government
                        agencies leading the space programs. As an example, America has NASA and
                        Russia has ESA. There are several competitors in the space race and I’m focusing
                        on two main competitors in this field, Elon Musk founder of SpaceX and Jeff Bezos
                        founder of Blue Origin. Let’s look at what SpaceX is…</p>

                    <img src="../img/Blog/blog2.jpg"
                        alt="img1" />
                    <div class="desc"></div>

                    <p>Elon Musk wants to establish a permanent selfsustaining city on Mars that thought led him to start SpaceX, aerospace
                        manufacture and space transportation organization. He always wants to reduce
                        the cost which spent on space transportation. So, he starts to develop launch
                        vehicles. In 2008 after three failures SpaceX launched Falcon 1 launch vehicle.
                        Falcon 1 became the first privately developed liquid fuel launch vehicle. After this
                        SpaceX was awarded a billion-dollar NASA contract to develop their next
                        generation vehicle called Falcon 9. It is a partially reusable launch vehicle. SpaceX
                        is the first private company that successfully launch orbit and recover a
                        spacecraft, named Dragon in 2010. In 2016 SpaceX started construct internet
                        constellation named Starlink. It consists of thousands of small satellites in low
                        Earth orbit. In 2018 they launched object into orbit around the Sun. Using Falcon
                        Heavy, they launched Tesla Roadster with a mannequin dressed in spacesuit
                        named “Starman” into Sun’s orbit. Musk views a Mars colony as a contingency
                        plan for humanity and a beacon of inspiration for humankind. Each of SpaceX’s
                        vehicles are tools in service of the movement towards building colonies and cities
                        on Mars. Using these vehicles SpaceX is actualizing Musk’s vision to open up the
                        space for human colonization. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The main competitor of Elon is Jeff Bezos founder of
                        Amazon. His vision to create a future where millions of people are living and
                        working in space led him to start aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital
                        spaceflight services company named Blue Origin. Jeff mainly focuses on building a
                        road to space with new rockets that could ultimately pave the way for floating
                        colonies, in order to do that he has planned sequence of bigger and bigger
                        rockets. They designed reusable and sub-orbital spaceflight named New Shepard
                        to take astronauts and payloads to the boundary of space. New Shepard is
                        expected to fly its first human astronauts to sub-orbital space in near future. And
                        then they launched New Glenn rocket which will be able to lift substantial
                        payloads to the moon like SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy. They hope to first fly of New
                        Glenn in 2021. In 2019 Bezos unveiled Blue’s near-term mission named as Blue
                        Moon, to colonize the moon for exploration, science and resource utilization. The
                        Blue Moon lunar lander which would travel to the moon by 2024. Bezos thought
                        that building these colonies will take generations but through Blue Origin he is
                        completing some of the fundamental requirements to achieve his vision.
                    </p>
                    <p>You all may have heard about NASA’s next lunar
                        landing project, named Artemis program. For this program NASA has chosen
                        three companies to design lunar landers. SpaceX and Blue Origin are also among
                        these three companies. This is the latest competition between these two
                        billionaires. These two companies look quite similar in its attempts to explore
                        space. That’s why there’s a tough competition between them. At the beginning
                        Blue Origin was leading this race. But in past ten years we often heard about
                        SpaceX’s missions and launches, Blue Origin does not come out to be so ambitious
                        in gaining attraction. Their competition started back in 2013 when NASA
                        announced auction about one of its launch pad LC-39A which used to launch
                        Saturn V models. SpaceX and Blue Origin fight to get this but at the end SpaceX
                        won the battle and owned LC-39A launch pad. The second battle was against Blue
                        Origin’s patent on landing rockets on ships at sea. SpaceX was plaining to land
                        first stage of Falcon 9 on ship at sea. They had to pay to Blue Origin in order to
                        land their rocket on sea because of the patent owned by Blue Origin. So, SpaceX
                        filled a case against this patent saying this concept is used earlier in novels and
                        films. At the end SpaceX won the case and got the permission to land their
                        rockets without paying. In 2015 a twitter battle between Elon and Jeff went viral. </p>
                    <p>
                        Blue Origin’s New Shepard successfully launched and landed and became first
                        sub-orbital rocket returned from space, at that time SpaceX’s Falcon 9 was at
                        experimental level. Elon posted about his earlier attempt where he used
                        Grasshopper rocket. However, Jeff’s New Shepard was successful than Elon’s
                        Grasshopper. In 2003 SpaceX started to design Falcon Heavy which is larger in size
                        and has highest payload capacity. To against this Blue Origin announced their
                        New Glenn rocket which is similar to Falcon Heavy. In this year SpaceX achieve
                        major victory by sending astronauts to international space station and bringing
                        them back to the earth. Aside all these rivalry because of the competition
                        between private companies there’s a silver lining for development of space
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>When space agencies like NASA and ESA opened for
                            business in 1900s’ private spaceflights were just a sci-fi dream. With the rise of
                            companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin make this dream come true. The main
                            difference between government agencies and the private companies is about the
                            budget. Private companies always run with their profit because of that they
                            always try to design highly efficient rockets with low cost. Non profitable
                            government agencies like NASA always wanted this. So now private companies
                            designing rockets behalf of NASA as well as other agencies. Because of this
                            competition there was a rapid development in space exploration in past 20 years.</p>
                    <p>As an overall conclusion I feel this competition
                            between world billionaires gives a positive impact on the field of astronomy as
                            well as existence of the humankind. Nowadays this space race is very popular
                            around the world and it is making huge enthusiasm about science and technology
                            among young generation. So, I hope in near future every one of us can be
                            experience our very own space journey.</p>
